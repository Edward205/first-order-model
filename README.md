Hello! I'm new to github and this is my first project. I want to create an easy to use user interface for the paper First Order Motion Model for Image Animation. This reposotory contains the bare minimum for main.py to run. If you want to run this make sure you have the requierements installed ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. For more information, check out the original github page https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model

**NOTE: I will have to take a break from updating this project. I'm currently busy with school.** If anyone cared...

Todo list:
- ➡️ Implement easy to use ui where you can just pick a photo, a driving video and the model and just click a button to have a video generated
- Easy video cropper 
- Implement Fashion Dataset and MGIF Dataset
- Implement Face swap
- Training on your own dataset
- Compile everything to one portable exe file
