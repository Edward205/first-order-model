Hello! I'm new to github and this is my first project. I want to create an easy to use user interface for the paper First Order Motion Model for Image Animation. For more information, check out the original github page https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model

Todo list:
- Implement easy to use ui where you can just pick a photo, a driving video and the model and just click a button to have a video generated
- Easy video cropper 
- Implement Fashion Dataset and MGIF Dataset
- Implement Face swap
- Training on your own dataset
